# Neural Network

For CS486 University of Waterloo  
Implements a n-layer Neural Network with given loss functions, learning rate, activation functions for each layer, and input. It trains doing iterations (epoch) of forward pass, backward pass, and updating the weights for each layers. It executes k-fold cross validation to train and test the given sample data. The sample data has input features which are the different charatersitics of the red wine and the output feature is the quality of the red wine.  
You'll need to download Python  
To run:  
Run the k_fold.py file using installed Python.
